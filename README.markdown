What's this?
------------------------

This extension will allow developers to add an interface to creating email templates in symphony.   
It does **NOT** have the functionality to override the ugly emails sent by symphony itself.  
Ofcourse, it is possible to send prettier emails using this extension, but it will require a custom event.

This extension is developed mainly for the Email Newsletter extension in mind.
